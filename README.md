Users can share their favorite records with friends across different music streaming services.

## Three main features:

1. Searching for albums dynamically populates links to available streaming services using their APIs.
2. Liking an album automatically creates user collections. 
3. User collections can be viewed collectively in groups that users can create and/or join. These groups limit the number of times the album has been liked to those of the users in the group only.

## Back End:

* Rails
* Spotify API
* iTunes Search API

## Front End:

* React
* Foundation
* jQuery
* Sass
* Webkit

## In Progress:

* Integrating D3.js to display album data (primarily the popularity of an album amongst tape users)
* Displaying albums according to different categories (by artist, genre, etc.)
