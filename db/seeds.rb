# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# album = Album.create(
#   name: "22, A Million",
#   image_url: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ddf6cf4e4e4306f371bd24814bb2400e9343851c",
#   year: 2017,
#   kind: "album"

# RSpotify::Album.find("1PgfRdl3lPyACfUGH4pquG").tracks_cache.each do |track|
#   song = Song.create(name: track.name, album: Album.first, track: track.track_number)
#   SongUrl.create(song: song, service: "Spotify", url: track.external_urls["spotify"])
