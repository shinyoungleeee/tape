My app is called "tape." It's a site that enables a user to have easy access to
all of the streaming services that hold a particular song, album, artist, or
playlist. Song, album, artist, and playlist modules will be viewable on separate
index pages. Each index page will show all modules in order of popularity.
Popularity will change based on user likes/dislikes. Index pages will have
additional querying (e.g. genre, release date, etc.), which will limit what is
displayed. Users will also be able to create groups to limit popularity votes to
only those made by users in that group. This will enable users to be able to see
what's most popular amongst their friends.
